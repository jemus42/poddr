# poddr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of poddr is to collect podcast data so I can display it at [podcasts.jemu.name](https://podcasts.jemu.name/). It's not intended to be a real package for real people.

## Installation

You can install the released version of poddr from here with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("jemus42/poddr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(poddr)
## basic example code
```
