The goal of poddr is to collect podcast data so I can display it at
[podcasts.jemu.name](https://podcasts.jemu.name/). Itâ€™s not intended to
be a real package for real people.

## Installation

You can install the released version of poddr from here with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("jemus42/poddr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r

## basic example code
```
